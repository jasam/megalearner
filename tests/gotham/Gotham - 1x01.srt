1
00:00:56,712 --> 00:00:59,214
- Oh.
- Hey!

2
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:07,655
What? I think she... got my wallet.

3
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,790
Yeah. Hey!

4
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:11,059
Hey, stop!

5
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:12,227
Stop her!

6
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:38,586
Psst, psst.

7
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:48,596
Oh, come on, Tom.

8
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,798
It wasn't that bad. Oh, no?

9
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:51,599
Childish drivel.

10
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:54,736
The acting was fine; the music was lovely.

11
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,838
What about you, Bruce?

12
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:59,974
Sorry, Mom, I agree with Dad.

13
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:02,243
- It was kinda lame.
- "Kinda lame"?

14
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:05,180
There's no such word as
"kinda." It was totally lame.

15
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:06,915
You two, so judgment...

16
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:08,016
What's up, folks?

17
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,617
Stay calm, Bruce.

18
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:10,819
Give me your money!

19
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,356
No problem.

20
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:19,027
We're cooperating.

21
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:21,296
The necklace.

22
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,999
It's okay.

23
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:30,505
Easy.

24
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:03,905
Mom! Mom?

25
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,840
Dad?

26
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,975
Dad!

27
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,447
Dad!

28
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:31,266
Sit down!

29
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,568
Don't move! Yeah, don't touch my face!

30
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,705
Shut up!

31
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,473
I need my pills.

32
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:40,141
I need my pills.

33
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:42,110
You wish.

34
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:44,379
Come on! Where are my pills? Back, back.

35
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:46,381
- Come on. Give them to me.
- Back. Come on.

36
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,351
Where are my pills?!

37
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:57,759
I said give me my pills, bitch.

38
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:59,361
Hold your fire!

39
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:03,231
Hold your fire. I got this.

40
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,434
Hold your fire.

41
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:07,569
Hold...

42
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:09,571
Easy, easy.

43
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,406
Sir,

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,574
look at me.

45
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:14,042
Not at them, look at me.

46
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:16,778
My name's Jim. Jim Gordon. What's yours?

47
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:21,049
I need my pills.

48
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,784
Okay, well, everything's
gonna be all right.

49
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:24,486
Look at me, huh?

50
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,988
Got your pills right here.

51
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,590
Huh?

52
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:29,891
Want some pills?

53
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:33,628
Here you go, here you go, here's
some pills for you, all right?

54
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,767
These aren't my pills.

55
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:50,345
Sorry, guys. Didn't mean to
bark at you all like that.

56
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:53,415
- Got a little bit carried away.
- Get up! Hey!

57
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,916
Hey, hey, come on, man, take it easy!

58
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,985
Come on, guys! Hey, hey!

59
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,953
What the hell are you doing?

60
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,655
We had the drop on him.

61
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,257
Yeah, well, he's dropped, isn't he?

62
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,292
You could've gotten hurt. Rookie mistake.

63
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:06,094
Next time, shoot the son of a bitch.

64
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:08,163
If I shoot, that sets everybody off.

65
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:09,764
Gunfire every which way.

66
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:12,300
Somebody takes a cop's gun, you shoot him.

67
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,435
That's basic.

68
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,837
Yo, Bullock, Gordon, you're up!

69
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:17,172
Double homicide, Theater District.

70
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:19,474
Give me a break; shift's nearly over.

71
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,109
Yeah, nearly.

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,655
Oh, the legendary Harvey Bullock.

73
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:36,825
- No rest for the wicked, eh?
- Tannenbaum, looking crisp.

74
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:38,026
This is my new partner, James Gordon.

75
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,395
- What do we got?
- Just got here myself.

76
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:42,864
Male, female, gunshot.

77
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:44,599
Their kid saw the whole thing.

78
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:46,301
Poor bastard hasn't spoke a word yet.

79
00:05:59,348 --> 00:06:01,316
My name's James Gordon.

80
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,817
I'm a detective.

81
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,719
What's your name?

82
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:10,792
It's okay. You don't have to talk.

83
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:13,361
Listen, T., do me a favor.

84
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:14,562
You didn't see me, okay?

85
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,631
I see you right in front of me.

86
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,335
- What's your problem?
- That's Thomas and Martha Wayne.

87
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:23,104
I don't need that kind of hassle.

88
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,006
Call Major Crimes;
they'd love to have this.

89
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,908
Yeah, but they're not here.

90
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:29,177
And your partner is talking to the witness.

91
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:33,114
So... that makes it your case.

92
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:36,484
Bruce.

93
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:40,355
My-my name is Bruce Wayne.

94
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,893
Can you tell me what happened, Bruce?

95
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,610
When I was about your age,

96
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:03,945
a drunk driver hit our car.

97
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:07,215
Killed my dad.

98
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,250
I was right next to him.

99
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:15,924
I know how you feel right now.

100
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:20,395
And I promise you,

101
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:24,366
however dark and scary the
world might be right now,

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,135
there will be light.

103
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,873
There will be light, Bruce.

104
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,044
We just got out of the movies.

105
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:41,616
We were walking through the alley
to catch an uptown cab, and...

106
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:45,620
a man came out of the shadows.

107
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:47,522
He-he was tall

108
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:50,625
with a black mask and...

109
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,062
he had a hat and gloves...

110
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,997
and shiny shoes.

111
00:07:56,032 --> 00:08:00,335
He took my dad's wallet
and my mom's necklace.

112
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:04,172
And then he shot them

113
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:05,473
for no reason.

114
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:08,944
I should've done something!

115
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,979
But I was too scared.

116
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:14,816
There was nothing you could've
done to stop what happened.

117
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,851
But there is something you can do now.

118
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,923
You can be strong.

119
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,926
Be strong.

120
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:27,429
I promise you,

121
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,197
I will find the man who did this.

122
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,302
Hey.

123
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,104
Who the hell is that?

124
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:52,320
James Gordon.

125
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:54,389
Alfred Pennyworth.

126
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:56,858
We're gonna get the guy that did this, sir.

127
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:59,160
New boy, are you?

128
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:01,162
You could say.

129
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:03,698
Good luck, mate.

130
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,234
Come on.

131
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:11,606
Don't look. Head up, eyes front.

132
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,541
Don't let them see you crying.

133
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,268
Shouldn't we be there
when they move the victims?

134
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:31,736
Why?

135
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,306
Listen, hot shot, do me a favor.

136
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,709
Don't start talking to
witnesses until I say so.

137
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,511
- What's your problem?
- My problem, soldier boy,

138
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:44,515
you just caught us a
gigantic, flaming ball of crap.

139
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,717
Oh, yeah, how's that?

140
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,186
You never heard of Thomas and Martha Wayne?

141
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,588
Yeah, sure, the Wayne Foundation.

142
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,956
Yeah.

143
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,325
Two of the richest and most
powerful people in Gotham.

144
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,996
You can't begin to imagine the pressure,
we don't close this thing quick.

145
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,365
- So let's close it quick.
- Yeah, right.

146
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,367
This is random street robbery, Holmes.

147
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,004
Perp could be any one of
10,000 mopes out there.

148
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,240
Oh, crap.

149
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,875
Order up!

150
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,178
Well, well, well, if it
isn't Montoya and Allen.

151
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,846
Major Crimes Unit.

152
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,915
This is my new partner, Jim Gordon.

153
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,249
Nice to meet you.

154
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,584
Hi, Harvey.

155
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,620
You're on the Waynes, huh? Terrible thing.

156
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,755
Yeah.

157
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,856
Any leads?

158
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,592
- Just getting started.
- I'll be straight.

159
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,494
You want us to take it off your hands?

160
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,231
No, no, no, no, no, this
is our... Hold on, rook. Ah.

161
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,767
Why you want it?

162
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,101
You got a lead?

163
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,004
Nah. Just need the press action.

164
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,340
I don't know.

165
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:45,009
Come on, Bullock, you know
you're scared of this case.

166
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,378
- You're damn right I'm scared.
- So then do the right thing for once.

167
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,380
"For once"?

168
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,583
Where the hell you get the
nerve to say that to me?

169
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,017
You can kiss my ass.

170
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,586
Okay, you be that way, brother.

171
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,387
Just trying to be collegial here.

172
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,525
You know, I almost gave it to you,

173
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,827
but you couldn't help yourself, could you?

174
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,963
You had to go and be disrespectful.

175
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,564
Okay, Harvey.

176
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,066
Stay frosty.

177
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,068
Good luck.

178
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,539
Self-righteous do-gooding skell huggers.

179
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,975
Always bad-mouthing us

180
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,977
like they're such freaking angels. Please.

181
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,246
As mayor of this great city,

182
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,248
I swear to you, the perpetrators
of this heinous crime

183
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,415
will be captured

184
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,252
and will be punished to the fullest extent.

185
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,287
I swear that to you.

186
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,789
Poor bastard. First a
crime wave and now this.

187
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,324
You take all the people
and resources you need.

188
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,693
You just close this case.

189
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,295
Yes, Captain.

190
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,797
Jim, will you give us a minute?

191
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,102
Captain.

192
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,173
The answer's no.

193
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,180
Yes! What do I have to
do, change his diapers?

194
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,916
You got to be kidding!

195
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,618
I don't care!

196
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,597
She said you had to keep me, huh?

197
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,965
Yeah, she did.

198
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,900
She said you were a war hero

199
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,938
and your daddy was a big shot
D.A. back in the olden days,

200
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,473
so I have to keep my trap
shut and do as I'm told.

201
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,942
Ouch.

202
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,344
Listen, kid, you got juice; do me a favor.

203
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,146
Ask for a transfer.

204
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,482
Sorry, this is where the action
is. You'll get used to me.

205
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,485
Jim, you seem like a nice guy,

206
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,455
but this is not a city
or a job for nice guys.

207
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:38,590
You understand?

208
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,525
No.

209
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,993
And that's your problem.

210
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,229
You're a cynic.

211
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,699
A slovenly, lackadaisical cynic.

212
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,170
You're probably right.

213
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,874
Okay, soldier boy,

214
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,909
let's go roust some muggers.

215
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,046
"Lackadaisical"? Hmm.

216
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,657
Hey.

217
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,161
How you doing?

218
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,248
- Guess what this is?
- Just tell me, Ed.

219
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,217
I want riddles, I'll read the funny pages.

220
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,856
It's a .45 caliber 300-grain
cupronickel wadcutter.

221
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,724
Came out of Thomas Wayne's chest.

222
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,960
- That's a six-dollar bullet.
- Uh-huh.

223
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,228
What kind of gun...

224
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,430
Ah-ah-ah, don't ask, just tell.

225
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,033
It's from a pistol not
known by our database.

226
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,568
And no print, either.

227
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,136
What else you got?

228
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,805
What's nowhere but everywhere,
except where something is?

229
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,073
Nothing.

230
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,577
You need professional
help, Nygma, seriously.

231
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,011
Let's go.

232
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,448
So I'm thinking,
our man wears shiny shoes,

233
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:14,385
uses high-end ammo, and nobody
on the street knows who he is?

234
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,154
Maybe he's not from the street.

235
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,656
Like a debonair playboy
robber, does it for kicks?

236
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,992
Who would pretend to
be a street robber, huh?

237
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,627
A professional contract killer

238
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,929
or somebody with a personal
grudge against the Waynes.

239
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,932
How did this professional know the
Waynes would be coming down that alley?

240
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,167
That's a good question.

241
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,202
Essen said we don't catch
a break in the first 48,

242
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,804
it's time to go see Fish Mooney.

243
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,806
Fish Mooney? That works
for Carmine Falcone?

244
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,608
Her. Theater District's her turf.

245
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,910
Anything happens down
there, she hears about it.

246
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,092
Tell Fish I'm here.

247
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,033
I still care for you,
deeply, but I don't believe

248
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,501
that you still care for me anymore.

249
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,438
I c-c-care for you!

250
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,308
Then where's my money?

251
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,343
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

252
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,282
Boy!

253
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,651
Sorry.

254
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,287
If you let this hair
go frizzy, you will be.

255
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,658
Ma'am, Detective Bullock is here.

256
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,930
- Keep him warm.
- Yes, ma'am.

257
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,167
Hey, Oswald?

258
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,303
You want a turn? May I?

259
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,437
Knock yourself out, kid.

260
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,540
Thank you, Mr. Gilzean.

261
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,188
- Harvey.
- Fish.

262
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,925
Where have you been?

263
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,527
Where haven't I been?

264
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,900
- Who's the friend?
- Detective James Gordon, ma'am.

265
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,837
Well, aren't you a cool glass of milk?

266
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:16,841
Ma'am, was that screaming
we heard back there?

267
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,210
Yes, my boys are watching a scary movie.

268
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,945
Really? No.

269
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,382
Actually, one of my staff has
been stealing money from me,

270
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,552
so we're beating his punk ass.

271
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,954
Relax, junior.
Fish gets some leeway.

272
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,224
Her staff are rough
characters, need firm handling.

273
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,161
So, this isn't a social visit then?

274
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,762
Unfortunately not.

275
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,931
Brass sent me by to talk to
you about the Wayne murders.

276
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,266
Terrible thing.

277
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,069
Listen, junior, if you're worried,

278
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,306
why don't you go back there and see
if anyone wants to press charges?

279
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,141
If that's okay with you, Fish.

280
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,077
Mi casa es su casa.

281
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,762
- Oswald, whoa.
- Yeah, take it easy, penguin.

282
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,064
You know I don't like to be called that.

283
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,732
Ooh, scary.

284
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,501
How's everybody doing?

285
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,436
Who are you?

286
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,472
James Gordon, GCPD.

287
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,673
Oh.

288
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,907
You came with Harvey, huh?

289
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,276
Glad to know you, James. I'm Butch Gilzean.

290
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,179
Drop the bat.

291
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,815
Ah, come on now.

292
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,851
Oswald and Raoul here

293
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,419
were just having a little
fun, weren't you, boys?

294
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,121
All in fun.

295
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,455
No problem.

296
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,690
Fun.

297
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,526
You a new guy, huh?

298
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,696
How do you like Gotham so far?

299
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,731
Well enough.

300
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,602
See you around.

301
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,712
Oh, hey.

302
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,447
Everything all right back there?

303
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,217
It's always good to see you, Harvey.

304
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,216
Wow.

305
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:38,285
And look at you in your excellent suit.

306
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,721
You know, I'm so happy

307
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:43,724
you don't have to wear
that silly uniform anymore.

308
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,225
You told me it looked good.

309
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,695
I lied.

310
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,698
You ready to rock and roll?

311
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:54,501
Uh... Barbara, I'm beat.

312
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,370
Do we really have to go to this thing?

313
00:18:56,404 --> 00:18:58,672
No.

314
00:18:58,707 --> 00:18:59,974
Of course not.

315
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,009
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

316
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:07,715
So...

317
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,283
talk to me.

318
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,752
We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.

319
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:15,789
I made a promise to Bruce
Wayne and I can't deliver.

320
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,891
But you will.

321
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:20,494
I don't know.

322
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,096
Maybe I'm out of my depth.

323
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,139
Hey.

324
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:27,209
I very much doubt you're out of your depth,

325
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:29,311
but even if you are,

326
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:31,713
you know how to swim, don't you?

327
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:34,383
Yes, I do.

328
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,318
So swim.

329
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,554
I'll swim, you're right.

330
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:41,323
You hungry?

331
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:42,991
I'm all right.

332
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:44,626
Had a few dogs.

333
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,195
When I am Mrs. Gordon, and you
are living here all the time,

334
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,032
I am gonna put you on
a proper, healthy diet.

335
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,068
Mm-hmm.

336
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:11,386
I got a lead.

337
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:14,089
Meet me at Fourth and Grundy in an hour.

338
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:15,724
On my way.

339
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,243
Hey.

340
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:36,244
Whoa.

341
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,046
You all right?

342
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:41,216
- Couple drinks, I'll be fine.
- Bullock...

343
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,619
Fish Mooney heard from one of her fences,

344
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:47,356
guy tried to sell him an antique
four-strand pearl necklace

345
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,492
with gold settings, one strand broken.

346
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,461
Like Martha Wayne was wearing.

347
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:54,496
Guy's name is Mario Pepper.

348
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,266
Career street thug.

349
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:02,604
robbery, assault,
rape, extortion, drug dealing.

350
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,640
Nice guy.

351
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:13,115
Hi.

352
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:15,784
What's your name? Ivy.

353
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:17,986
Ivy. Is Daddy home?

354
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:19,755
You don't want to talk to Daddy.

355
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,089
Why's that, Ivy?

356
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,127
He's mean.

357
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:27,129
Hey, who is it?!

358
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,634
Mario Pepper, we need to talk.

359
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:35,103
I've done nothing.

360
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:38,840
So it'll be a pleasant talk.

361
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:42,477
Where were you last
Saturday night around 9:30?

362
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:45,814
I was here at home with my family.

363
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,616
That's right. He was here.

364
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,818
Pearl necklace sound familiar?

365
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,287
No.

366
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:55,991
Then I guess you don't mind we,
uh, take a look around the place.

367
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:58,493
You need a warrant.

368
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,395
You're a felon on parole.

369
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,130
All we need is reasonable cause.

370
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:20,949
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

371
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:02,491
Out of the way!

372
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,971
Thanks.

373
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:07,306
Probably? I had to.

374
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:23,822
We got him!

375
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,660
We got him.

376
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:30,963
Huh?

377
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:32,031
Hmm?

378
00:25:03,697 --> 00:25:06,365
Mario Pepper was framed by
Fish Mooney and the cops.

379
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:10,736
I saw Ms. Mooney with
Martha Wayne's necklace.

380
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,839
She was discussing how to
get it into Pepper's home

381
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,841
inside a bag of drugs.

382
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,509
This was shortly after she met with

383
00:25:17,544 --> 00:25:19,578
Detectives Bullock and Gordon
from the homicide squad.

384
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:23,215
Mooney works with Carmine Falcone's mob.

385
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:25,317
You saying Falcone had the Waynes killed?

386
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:27,252
I'm just telling you what I saw.

387
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:29,388
Why? Why snitch on your own boss?

388
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:31,490
I confess, that...

389
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:33,726
that poor orphan boy pricked my conscience.

390
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,327
Nah.

391
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:37,596
You want to push Fish out, huh?

392
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,201
That's beside the point.

393
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:44,336
I've done my civic duty.

394
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,605
Good day to you both.

395
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,623
You kept your promise.

396
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:38,824
Thank you.

397
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:41,727
I'm sorry you didn't see a trial.

398
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:43,963
That's okay.

399
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:03,015
Renee.

400
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:04,483
Long time.

401
00:27:04,517 --> 00:27:06,619
Yeah.

402
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:13,926
Sorry to drop by unexpected like this.

403
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:17,763
How have you been?

404
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:20,332
I'm good.

405
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:23,402
- You?
- All good.

406
00:27:23,436 --> 00:27:25,604
You're running an art gallery now, right?

407
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:29,241
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

408
00:27:29,276 --> 00:27:30,676
And I'm engaged.

409
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,311
That's why I'm here.

410
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:33,879
Oh?

411
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:36,882
The GCPD framed Mario Pepper
for the murder of the Waynes.

412
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:39,285
What?

413
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:42,054
They framed and killed an innocent man.

414
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:44,223
And you're here to tell me
that James was in on this?

415
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:46,458
- Yes.
- And what's your proof?

416
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:48,560
I can't tell you, but it's the truth.

417
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:51,397
James Gordon is not a good guy.

418
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:52,731
You deserve better.

419
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:56,702
James Gordon is the most
honest man I've ever met.

420
00:27:56,736 --> 00:27:58,704
He's not capable of doing that.

421
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:00,573
You sure you know what he's capable of?

422
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:01,974
Yes, thank you. I know him.

423
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:03,475
Does he know you?

424
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,144
Don't.

425
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:08,380
Like I know you?

426
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:17,957
Here you are.

427
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:22,628
Barbara?

428
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:25,464
What's wrong?

429
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,333
Did you frame Mario Pepper?

430
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,405
- No.
- I knew it.

431
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,874
Who told you that Pepper was framed?

432
00:28:34,908 --> 00:28:36,508
It doesn't matter, as
long as it's not true.

433
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:38,043
It's not. Who told you it was?

434
00:28:38,078 --> 00:28:39,879
Nobody.

435
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:42,681
Bee, I know when you're lying.

436
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:46,685
Montoya!

437
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:52,591
What's your evidence
that Pepper was framed?

438
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:54,593
I was wrong to reveal that
information to Barbara.

439
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:57,463
- We're old friends.
- I asked what evidence you have.

440
00:28:57,497 --> 00:29:00,366
You'll see the evidence when we get you

441
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,735
and your crooked friends into a courtroom.

442
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,236
We're working on it.

443
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:06,972
Save your energy.

444
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:09,542
If Pepper was framed, I'll find out.

445
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:12,278
Hey. We got a problem here, Gordon?

446
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:16,615
And then you and you just
need to stay out of my way.

447
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:22,154
- Mrs. Pepper...
- Go away.

448
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:26,125
Ma'am... if your husband was
innocent, you need to talk to me.

449
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,634
If your husband didn't kill the
Waynes, how did he come to have

450
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:36,635
Martha Wayne's necklace?

451
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,138
You bastards planted it on him.

452
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:40,506
Bastards.

453
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:44,743
Alice, how would the
police have the necklace?

454
00:29:44,778 --> 00:29:47,246
- We didn't kill the Waynes.
- So you say.

455
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,215
God knows my husband had his demons,

456
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:50,950
but he never killed nobody.

457
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:54,153
Can I see his shoes?

458
00:29:54,187 --> 00:29:56,422
Shoes?

459
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:04,864
This is all of them?

460
00:30:04,898 --> 00:30:08,100
Uh-huh.

461
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:09,268
Damn.

462
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:10,436
Framed?

463
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,104
How you figure?

464
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:14,540
You were there. We framed him?

465
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:15,941
Somebody could've planted
the necklace on Pepper

466
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:17,142
for us to find.

467
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:18,677
Fish Mooney could've
set the whole thing up.

468
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:19,812
Why?

469
00:30:19,846 --> 00:30:22,548
To cover up for the real killer.

470
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:24,149
Mooney works for Falcone.

471
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:27,019
Maybe Falcone wanted the Waynes killed.

472
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:29,154
Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait, wait.

473
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:31,991
Why would such a nutty
idea even enter your head?

474
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:34,293
Montoya from MCU.

475
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:38,063
That pill-head loony
bird? What's her proof?

476
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:39,732
Wouldn't tell me. Didn't trust me.

477
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,534
She doesn't have any.

478
00:30:41,568 --> 00:30:43,335
If they did, they would've used it.

479
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,839
Pepper didn't wear shiny shoes.

480
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:48,674
He didn't own any shiny shoes.

481
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,876
Shiny shoes! Mother of God.

482
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:51,877
Shiny shoes.

483
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:53,846
Just suppose for a moment, just suppose

484
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,481
Pepper was innocent.

485
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:57,016
I killed him.

486
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,884
We killed him.

487
00:30:58,919 --> 00:30:59,919
We killed him.

488
00:31:00,954 --> 00:31:03,756
We'd lose our jobs at the very least.

489
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,759
The case is closed. Forget about it.

490
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:11,497
Even if the real killers
are still out there?

491
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:12,665
Yes.

492
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:16,435
This is very perilous
stuff you're messing with.

493
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:19,305
Listen to me, for once, Jim.

494
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:20,773
Forget about it.

495
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:32,918
Detective Gordon.

496
00:31:32,953 --> 00:31:34,453
Tell Mooney I'm here.

497
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,856
- May I ask why?
- No.

498
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,791
No. Yes.

499
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:41,927
James Gordon.

500
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:44,063
How nice.

501
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:47,066
Day I met you, when I was
out back with your boys,

502
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,734
what did you and Harvey talk about?

503
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:52,438
Should you ask Harvey?

504
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:54,206
He's your partner.

505
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:55,641
I'm afraid he might lie.

506
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:56,642
Hmm.

507
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:58,711
He might.

508
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:00,112
And you think I'll tell you the truth?

509
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,084
You just did.

510
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:08,988
James, wait.

511
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:17,663
You have a little danger in your eye.

512
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:22,067
I wonder what you plan to do with that.

513
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:23,936
You'll have to wait and see.

514
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:27,173
I hate surprises.

515
00:32:41,154 --> 00:32:43,088
Detective Bullock?

516
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:46,792
Miss Kean.

517
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:49,929
Uh, James went for a walk last
night and he never came back.

518
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,463
Have you heard from him?

519
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:53,165
I'm really worried about him.

520
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,668
He's on a stakeout.

521
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:56,836
Yeah.

522
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,138
His phone probably ran out of juice is all.

523
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:01,640
Oh.

524
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:03,642
Right. Well, that's a relief.

525
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,511
Thank you. No problem.

526
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:31,837
Wait! Wait!

527
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:33,005
Wait.

528
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,208
Shut up.

529
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,580
Hey, what are you doing?

530
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,901
We're over here, you'd get a better angle.

531
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:47,390
What?
You're a director now?

532
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,202
Get fresh, I'm just saying.

533
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,781
Hey, Butch!

534
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:55,923
Harvey.

535
00:33:56,978 --> 00:33:58,330
Who told you we'd be here?

536
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:00,514
Everybody knows this is where you...

537
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:02,753
Take your problems.

538
00:34:03,151 --> 00:34:04,485
That's my partner you got there.

539
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,253
Ex-partner.

540
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:08,422
Oh.

541
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:10,123
Let me talk to Fish.

542
00:34:11,693 --> 00:34:14,962
I'm not afraid of death
so much as I am of dying.

543
00:34:14,996 --> 00:34:17,698
I, um... I want to die how my father died,

544
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:19,133
peacefully in his sleep.

545
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,835
Not like his screaming,
terrified passengers.

546
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:29,309
Yeah?

547
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:31,044
Yeah. Bullock showed up at the plant.

548
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,813
- Wants to talk to you.
- Put him on.

549
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:34,948
Give me a moment, kid.

550
00:34:34,983 --> 00:34:36,116
You're doing good.

551
00:34:37,485 --> 00:34:39,319
- Fish?
- Speaking.

552
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:40,821
Don't be like that.

553
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:42,689
Listen, you got to let my boy go.

554
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:44,258
How long we been friends?

555
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,760
For a long time, until today.

556
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,929
I did a big favor for
you and your little pals,

557
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,331
and now it's all about
to blow up in my face

558
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:52,833
on account of your stupidity.

559
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:54,601
Look, the kid's not your problem here.

560
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,370
He was hipped to the frame by Major Crimes.

561
00:34:56,404 --> 00:34:57,704
They're gonna be coming after you.

562
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,340
How did they get onto me?

563
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,376
Usual way, I guess.

564
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,944
Somebody talked.

565
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,879
Huh. Not one of my people.

566
00:35:05,914 --> 00:35:07,214
That's what everybody says.

567
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:11,752
True.

568
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:14,154
Listen, you got to let my boy go. Hmm?

569
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:16,690
You kill my partner, I
got to come after you.

570
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:20,694
I don't want to do it,
but how am I gonna look,

571
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:22,863
you kill my partner, I don't make a move?

572
00:35:22,897 --> 00:35:24,531
All right.

573
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:27,534
Well, you have to promise me that
you'll keep him under control.

574
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:29,369
- I promise.
- Cool.

575
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:31,271
Put Butch on, please.

576
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:36,743
Yeah, boss?

577
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:38,812
That son of a bitch just threatened me.

578
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,447
You hang him up with his partner.

579
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:41,882
You got it.

580
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:44,218
Hey, how you doing?

581
00:35:44,252 --> 00:35:46,386
I'm good. We're going home.

582
00:35:46,421 --> 00:35:48,122
- Yeah?
- Gentlemen,

583
00:35:48,156 --> 00:35:49,756
I'm just glad everything could work out...

584
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:52,526
Cops.

585
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:57,397
Bless your heart.

586
00:35:57,432 --> 00:36:00,601
Would you be a sweet boy and rub my feet?

587
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:08,642
Give me a moment, darling. I
haven't forgotten about you.

588
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:10,144
I like you. You're funny.

589
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:16,750
Now, this amateur nonsense is a good sign.

590
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:19,453
There used to be some discipline.

591
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:22,222
Falcone is getting old and soft.

592
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:23,924
It's time.

593
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,493
Somebody has to take over;
it might as well be me.

594
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:28,095
Yes, it might as well.

595
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:32,566
And you, you're like a son
to me, you know that, Oswald?

596
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,501
I feel that way also.

597
00:36:34,536 --> 00:36:37,104
Which is what I don't understand.

598
00:36:37,138 --> 00:36:39,406
After all I've done for you,

599
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:42,276
and right when I'm on
the verge of great things,

600
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,144
you betray me.

601
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:46,647
Why would you betray your mother?

602
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:48,916
I-I... I don't know what you mean.

603
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,851
It was you.

604
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:54,988
You snitched to the MCU.

605
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:57,658
You want to know how I know?

606
00:36:57,692 --> 00:37:00,594
Because only you saw me with the pearls.

607
00:37:00,628 --> 00:37:02,763
No one else.

608
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:08,469
It was Gilzean.

609
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:10,003
He's the snitch.

610
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:14,308
No.

611
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:17,277
- Gilzean is loyal.
- So am I.

612
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:20,447
I would open a vein right here
and now if you asked me to.

613
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:27,187
Go on, then.

614
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:29,022
Open one.

615
00:37:31,392 --> 00:37:34,828
I... I was speaking poetically.

616
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:37,865
Prove it.

617
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:42,970
Prove your loyalty, my little penguin.

618
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:47,040
Please, Ms. Mooney.

619
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:48,342
Please don't!

620
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:57,317
You broke... my... heart!

621
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,495
How you doing?

622
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,930
Been better.

623
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:12,599
Thanks for trying to help.

624
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:14,268
Wish I hadn't.

625
00:38:14,302 --> 00:38:15,736
Did you just slap my hand?

626
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,104
Hey, Butch!

627
00:38:17,138 --> 00:38:18,238
Yeah, save your breath.

628
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:19,673
Look, if it was up to me,

629
00:38:19,707 --> 00:38:22,242
you'd get a bullet in the
head and a decent funeral,

630
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:24,244
but Fish has her ways.

631
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:27,548
Yo! Frankie!

632
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:29,216
Showtime.

633
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:43,897
Oh, God!

634
00:38:58,246 --> 00:39:00,380
Don Falcone.

635
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:04,184
Forgive me, young man, I
forget what your name is.

636
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,719
Or perhaps I never knew it.

637
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:08,122
Gilzean, sir.

638
00:39:08,156 --> 00:39:09,556
Gilzean.

639
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:12,493
Tell Ms. Mooney she's too impetuous.

640
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:16,630
If she wants to kill policemen,
she has to ask permission.

641
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:18,799
Sir.

642
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:25,172
There are rules.

643
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,943
Cut them down.

644
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:31,912
That's right, there are rules!

645
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:39,379
It's good to meet you at last, James.

646
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:42,349
I knew your father very well.

647
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:45,552
Best D.A. this city ever had.

648
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:48,355
He and I understood each other.

649
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:51,191
There was respect,

650
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,960
- friendship, even.
- Friendship?

651
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:57,330
Trust me,

652
00:39:57,365 --> 00:40:00,167
that's the only reason you're alive now.

653
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,335
Blood doesn't lie.

654
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,138
I know that when you leave
here, you'll do the right thing.

655
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:06,807
I will.

656
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:10,177
- I'll tell what I know.
- Which is what?

657
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:11,545
I know that you own the police department.

658
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,712
Probably the mayor, too.

659
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:16,483
And I was pretty sure that
you had the Waynes killed,

660
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,084
but if you did,

661
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,853
you wouldn't risk letting
me live, would you?

662
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:21,721
Then again,

663
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:25,625
how did Fish Mooney come to
have Martha Wayne's necklace?

664
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,261
- A replica?
- Yes.

665
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:31,498
But if you didn't have them
killed, why frame Mario Pepper?

666
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:35,235
Or are you covering up for somebody else?

667
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,404
Who knows who killed the Waynes?

668
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:39,372
Some lowlife.

669
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:41,575
We needed a culprit before the funeral.

670
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:45,011
Pepper was sacrificed so that
the people of Gotham would see

671
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:46,746
swift justice done.

672
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:49,416
So they can feel safe and secure.

673
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,018
- And that matters so much to you.
- Of course.

674
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:54,087
I'm a businessman.

675
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:57,257
You can't have organized
crime without law and order.

676
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:01,528
I love this city,

677
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:04,030
and I see it going to hell.

678
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,900
But I won't let it fall
apart without a fight.

679
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:09,936
You make a life of crime sound very noble.

680
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:13,340
You have a hard head,
James, just like your father.

681
00:41:13,374 --> 00:41:16,510
Don't be self-righteous.
Don't be arrogant.

682
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,145
You want me to keep quiet about all this?

683
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:22,015
Gotham is on a knife
edge. What do you suppose

684
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:24,451
bringing down City Hall
and the police force

685
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:26,520
will do, even if you could?

686
00:41:26,554 --> 00:41:29,289
Would it make things better?

687
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:34,728
In bocca Al Lupo.

688
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:54,114
Lookit, Jim... I'm listening.

689
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:57,384
I wasn't being honest with you.

690
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:59,219
But you weren't ready for the truth.

691
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,655
You didn't tell me
because you were ashamed.

692
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:07,961
Why are we stopping here?

693
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:12,132
No, please. Please, I beg of you!

694
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,633
Shut up!

695
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:16,002
This is the fool

696
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,637
that snitched to Montoya and Allen.

697
00:42:17,672 --> 00:42:20,474
Falcone wants you to walk
him to the end of that pier

698
00:42:20,508 --> 00:42:22,743
and put a bullet in his head.

699
00:42:22,777 --> 00:42:25,178
Then everybody knows
you're with the program.

700
00:42:29,951 --> 00:42:31,651
And if I don't?

701
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:33,653
Then I'm supposed to take you out

702
00:42:33,688 --> 00:42:35,021
and him, too.

703
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:38,291
And here's the thing, Jim. I like you.

704
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:41,795
I might not have the stomach
to do it, but I'll try.

705
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:43,463
'Cause if I don't,

706
00:42:43,498 --> 00:42:45,665
someone will get to you quick enough.

707
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,502
Then they're gonna get to me
and probably Barbara as well.

708
00:42:48,536 --> 00:42:50,170
Who knows what you told her.

709
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:51,872
I told her nothing.

710
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:53,473
You think Falcone cares?

711
00:42:53,508 --> 00:42:54,808
Come on.

712
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:56,143
You've killed people before.

713
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:57,544
That was war. This is war!

714
00:42:57,578 --> 00:43:00,013
We're at war with scumbags like him.

715
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:02,983
Sometimes in war, you got to do
a bad thing to do good, right?

716
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:04,885
So do you do this bad thing

717
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,787
or do you die and maybe your girl dies?

718
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:10,657
I might be lackadaisical,

719
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:11,992
hmm?

720
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,460
But that's not a tough call.

721
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:29,476
Walk.

722
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:50,497
Please, Mr. Gordon, just let me live.

723
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:53,567
I'll do whatever you say.
I-I'll be your slave for life.

724
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,068
Listen to me,

725
00:43:55,103 --> 00:43:56,870
there is a war coming.

726
00:43:56,904 --> 00:43:58,538
A-a terrible war.

727
00:43:58,573 --> 00:44:01,641
Falcone is losing his grip,
and his rivals are hungry.

728
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:04,745
There-there will be chaos.
Rivers of blood in the streets.

729
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:07,681
I know it! I-I can see it coming.

730
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:09,816
See, I'm clever that way.

731
00:44:09,851 --> 00:44:11,585
And I can help you.

732
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:13,387
I-I can be a spy.

733
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:15,422
Shut up!

734
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,359
Turn around.

735
00:44:23,064 --> 00:44:24,798
For God's sake, have mercy.

736
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:29,770
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

737
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:46,820
Attaboy.

738
00:44:54,262 --> 00:44:55,962
My God, James.

739
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:57,998
I've been so worried.

740
00:45:01,102 --> 00:45:03,103
What happened to you?

741
00:45:43,311 --> 00:45:44,845
Oi!

742
00:45:44,879 --> 00:45:47,481
Master Bruce, get your
bloody arse down off there!

743
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:50,183
How many times have I told you?!

744
00:45:57,158 --> 00:45:59,493
Why were you up on the roof?

745
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:02,195
I'm learning to conquer fear.

746
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,731
Fear doesn't need conquering.

747
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:07,000
Fear tells you where the edge is.

748
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:09,069
Fear is a good thing.

749
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:10,904
And you think I haven't
told him that, do you?

750
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,441
You came here for a reason, I imagine.

751
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:16,009
Yes,

752
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:18,879
Mario Pepper didn't kill your parents.

753
00:46:18,913 --> 00:46:21,982
He was framed by the police department

754
00:46:22,016 --> 00:46:24,351
and the mob working together.

755
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:26,753
We killed an innocent man.

756
00:46:26,788 --> 00:46:29,256
Right.

757
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,825
- So who did it then?
- I don't know.

758
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:32,926
I see.

759
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,095
Sterling work there then, mate, isn't it?

760
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:36,697
Yes.

761
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,332
I'm sorry.

762
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:42,502
Don't be.

763
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:47,507
I'm glad he's still alive.

764
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,445
I want to see him again.

765
00:46:51,479 --> 00:46:52,913
I'm asking you

766
00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:56,083
to give me a second chance.

767
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:58,685
I'm going to find out who
killed your parents and why,

768
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,122
and I'm gonna clean up the
damn police department if I can,

769
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:04,424
but I can only do that from the inside.

770
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:06,059
So I'm asking you

771
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:08,028
to stay silent

772
00:47:08,062 --> 00:47:10,697
about what I've told you.

773
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,534
Your call.

774
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:17,104
Right, well, that's all
convenient, isn't it?

775
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:18,972
Alfred!

776
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:40,594
Thank you.

777
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:41,819
